# GitHub issues viewer app
By Samuel Umeh

This project is just a solution to a coding challenge for a Frontend Position.

## The challenge description:

**Challenge for the job opening Senior Frontend Engineer**

This scenario is meant to test your every capability in programming modern day applications.
Specifically, we want you to build a frontend for a GraphQL API. The result of your little scenario is then presented by
you in person.

We want you to build a frontend for the GitHub GraphQL API. The frontend should allow to browse the issues of a 
GitHub repository, specifically of the official React repository. You will build a little search which allows to
search for a text term in either the body or title of the issues as well as for the status OPEN or CLOSED.
After listing these issues, a user should be able to view a single issue and all the comments. Please ensure that
sufficient queries of users are faster than initial requests with a reasonable caching strategy.

Every important aspect of the application shall be tested. Rules to programming style apply as usual and
documentation shall be down to a minimum. Your application should be able to handle wrong input by the
user or any unusual behavior.

For this scenario we expect you to deliver a high quality web application. Your code should be typed using
either Typescript or Flow. Furthermore, we expect you to use all available ES6+ features, including
Async programming style. Your implementation is based on React with a structured state management using Redux and a
sensible routing strategy. Alternatively, you may apply Apollo and appropriate client side state
management.

- [https://github.com/facebook/react](https://github.com/facebook/react) (Repository of React)

**Following are the relevant technologies to use:**
- ECMAScript 6+ with async
- TypeScript 2.5+ as a bonus instead of ECMAScript 6+
- React.js
- Webpack
